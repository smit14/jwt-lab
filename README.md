1. Create private and public keys using RSA algorithm. Store it in `keys` folder. Use `openssl genpkey`

1. Implement function in `helper.js` that creates a digital signature of a data.

1. Implement function in `helper.js` that verifies digital signature.

1. Implement function in `auth-server/app.js` that creates a JWT. 

1. Implement function in `application-server/app.js` that verifies a JWT. 

1. Implement function in `application-server/app.js` that decodes user information from JWT.

# How to run
